Project done as part of my "Computer Networks" class in 2nd year of University.
Report attached with more detailes, but to summarise:
This app was done independently in 2-3 weeks. Provided with an xml database of train information, it allows users to see:
  - information about all the trains arriving today
  - information about all the trains either coming in or leaving within the next hour

Users can also:
  - announce if a train is late and by how much
  - request a manual refresh of the list

Internally, the app makes sure:
  - all the information displayed to the users is updated in real time (it takes into account delays)
  - reported delays are checked for validity

There is no graphical interface for the project. As per the recieved specifications, I was to develop a server, the client being the bare minimum required for the app to function.
